## Acknowledgments

This project was created while learning Compose, so I wasn't very familiar with Compose at the beginning. Some of the project's code is derived from two excellent open-source projects (the theme module is from ReadYou).

I'll gradually improve it, but the power of one person is limited. Pull requests are welcome.
